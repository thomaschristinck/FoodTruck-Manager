This was a project I worked on for Introduction to Software Engineering at McGill. The idea was to develop a web, desktop, and mobile app to help a foodtruck manager manage inventory, staff, etc.. The apps we developed were very basic as the focus of the course was on design patterns and good practice in software engineering, and less on the actual design. The java application I wrote is downloadable as a runnable .jar file.
