 -During the project the hardest part about android was to figure how to implement persistence. We finally solved the issue by changing the way the persistence was written in the .Jar file and creating a .xml file outside of the .Jar File. The tests on android can be omitted because the controller is herited from the Desktop app that tested them before. 		
 -At the last minute, an error appeared in the version of the jar used so one functionality stopped working. With only few hours before the final hand off, we werenâ€™t able to solve the problem. Matched with the right Jar, the Buttons Order and Delete Order are working (as shown in the demo in class).
